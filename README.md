# Learning Labs

**This is where I break things, fix them, and learn how the web actually works – one bug at a time.**  

This repository is a hands-on practice ground where I experiment with concepts by recreating projects from tutorials, tackling web development challenges, and exploring ideas inspired by open-source projects, blogs, and community resources. Every line of code here is written to understand *why things work* (or sometimes why they *don’t*)—because nothing teaches better than breaking stuff and yelling at the console first.
