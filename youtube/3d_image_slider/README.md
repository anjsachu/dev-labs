A **totally over-engineered** 3D slider made with plain old HTML, CSS
Why? Because we can. Also… because I was learning 3D transforms and needed an excuse.

## 🙏 Credits (aka "Don’t Sue Me")

This masterpiece is **99% tutorial magic** and **1% me pretending to know what I’m doing**:

- **YouTube Tutorial**: by Lun Dev Code  
  https://youtu.be/yqaLSlPOUxM?si=9EUAlCVtToEYgX7n

- **GitHub Demo**: HoanghoDev’s slider*3d <br>

  *(Seriously, go check it out. It’s the real MVP.)\_

## 🚀 Why This Exists?

Because copying tutorials is cheaper than therapy and a great way to learn stuff.  
Also, sliders are fun. End of story.
