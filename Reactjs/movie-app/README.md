## üß† What I Learned (and Googled a lot)

- Mastered the art of convincing React to rerender _only_ when necessary ‚Äî thanks to the magical `useDebounce` hook that said "no" to API overloads.
- Built a search bar so smart it could probably guess what you're thinking (just kidding... or are we?).
- Fetched movie data from the **TMDB API** like a Netflix intern on a deadline.
- Learned how to _rank_ trending movies/series based on user searches ‚Äî basically built our own tiny IMDb.
- Styled everything with **Tailwind CSS** because writing regular CSS is so last season.
- Accidentally fell in love with `useEffect` and `useState` while debugging... repeatedly.
